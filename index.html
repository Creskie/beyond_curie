		<p class="paragraph">Margaret Ann Bulkley was a war hero, a medical pioneer, and a brilliant surgeon. Born in a time when women were not permitted to pursue medicine, she disguised herself as a boy and never looked back. After graduating from medical school she enlisted in the British military. She crafted the swashbuckling, flirtatious, "ladies' man" persona of Dr. James Barry to avoid suspicion as she practiced medicine all over the British Empire. While in Cape Town, she performed the first successful Caesarean section by a European doctor. In 1866, she delivered a future prime minister of South Africa via Caesarean section, who was named James Barry Munnik Hertzog in her honor. She rose through the ranks of the British military to become the Inspector General of Hospitals. She was a public health advocate who fought for better nutrition, sanitation and care for prisoners, lepers, soldiers and their families.<br><br>Only after she died did anyone discover her secret. The scandal rocked the Victorian establishment, and the army placed an embargo on James Barry's military record for a hundred years. Margaret Ann Bulkley could have stayed home, married and had kids. But she was determined to become a doctor even if it meant living a lie. She was not only the first British woman to graduate in medicine but also one of the day’s most infamous and respected surgeons.</p>

She is regarded as the world's first computer programmer for her publication in 1843, suggesting the data input that would program the Analytic Machine to calculate Bernoulli numbers, now considered the first computer program. Babbage was so impressed, he dubbed her the "Enchantress of Numbers."<br><br>Beyond understanding the intricacies of Babbage's machine, Ada Lovelace was a visionary. She predicted what would happen 100 years in the future, that machines like the Analytical Engine could be used to compose music, create graphics, and would be vital for scientific progress. She understood that numbers could be used to represent so much more than just quantities. Lovelace became a brilliant mathematician, thanks in part to opportunities that were denied most women of the time. Born into aristocracy, the daughter of famous poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabella Milbanke, she was already destined for the history books. But her curiosity about how society relates to technology as a collaborative tool and contributions to the field of mathematics made her a pioneer.</p>

Despite NASA's rigid protocol, she would always begin each shift with a salute that only a Trekkie could appreciate, "hailing frequencies open" she would repeat throughout the 8-day mission. Because of her love of dance, she took an Alvin Ailey poster with her on the mission saying that "science and dance are both expressions of the boundless creativity that people have to share with one another". She left NASA in 1993 to start the Jemison Group that researches, markets and develops science and technology for daily life.</p>

She was born in 1909 in Turin into a Sephardi Jewish family. Her father discouraged her aspirations of becoming a doctor because he feared it would disrupt her life as a wife and mother. She became a doctor anyway and began a career in neurology research. Her academic career was cut short as a result of Mussolini's 1938 ban barring Jews from academic and professional careers. So she set up a laboratory in her bedroom and studied the growth of nerve fibers in chicken embryos, which laid the groundwork for her later research.<br><br>In 1946 she was granted a fellowship at Washington University in St. Louis. She replicated her previous work done in her makeshift bedroom lab and was offered a research position at the university which she held for 30 years. There, in 1952 she did her most important work, isolating the nerve growth factor from observations of certain cancerous tissues that cause extremely rapid growth of nerve cells. She became the first Nobel Laureate ever to reach the age of 100.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">Rosalyn Sussman Yalow, was an American medical physicist and winner of the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the development of the radioimmunoassay (RIA) technique. RIA is a technique used to measure minute quantities of hormones and other antigens in the human body. Rosalyn first used it to study insulin levels in diabetes mellitus but it has been widely used in a number of detection screens, from looking for the presence of drugs to identifying certain disease or allergy markers like peptic ulcers. The process involves "tagging" or labeling known antigens with radioactive isotopes so they can be easily identified. RIA is considered the pioneer in nuclear medicine radioactive measurements because radioactive substances show up with great accuracy and clarity. Though it is still used in labs around the world, labs are shifting towards methods that rely less on radioactivity.<br><br>Rosalyn started out as a part-time secretary, not believing that any graduate school would admit and provide financial support to a woman. But soon after picking up some stenography skills on the side she was offered a teaching assistantship at the University of Illinois because the university decided to offer spots to women instead of shut down, since WWII had sent most of the men overseas. She earned her PhD there and was the only woman among the department's 400 members and the first since 1917. For her extraordinary work she was awarded the 1972 William S.

		<p class="paragraph">Grace Hopper was an American computer scientist and US Navy Rear Admiral. She's often referred to as the Admiral of the Cybersea or "Amazing Grace" for her many computing innovations. After earning her PhD in mathematics from Yale in 1934, she enlisted in the Navy, graduated first in her class and began working on the Mark I computer. In 1949, she recommended that a new programming language be developed using entirely English words, but was told very quickly that she couldn't do this because computers didn't understand English. Her idea wasn't accepted for 3 years, but by 1952 she had an operational compiler, A-0. A compiler is a computer program that converts code written in a language that programmers can understand to 0s and 1s for the computer to understand.<br><br>She is also known for popularizing the term "computer bug" after she found an actual moth trapped in the Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator and deemed the machine "debugged" after retrieving the insect. Grace also developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and components for early programming languages like COBOL and FORTRAN.<br><br>Her awards are many, including the National Medal of Technology and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The USS Hopper, nicknamed “Amazing Grace”, is on a very short list of US military vessels named after women. A few days ago Yale announced that it is renaming Calhoun College after her. Grace Hopper believed in taking chances and the potential of young people. To quote her: the most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler, is training young people.</p>

In 1980, Linda began her post-doctoral research at Columbia University where she set out to map out how pheromones and odors are detected in the nose and interpreted by the brain. Her landmark paper published in 1991 described how hundreds of genes code for the odorant sensors located in the olfactory neurons of our noses. Each receptor is a protein that changes when an odor attaches to the receptor, causing a signal to be sent to the brain. By analyzing rat DNA, she was able to estimate that there are about 1000 different genes for olfactory receptors in the mammalian genome. Remarkably, each olfactory neuron only expresses one kind of olfactory receptor protein, and the input from neurons expressing the same receptor is collected by a single dedicated glomerulus, a spherical structure in the olfactory bulb that shuttles the signal to the rain. She won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2004 for her work on olfactory receptors. Her work has opened the doors to the genetic and molecular analysis of our sense of smell.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">Rosalind Franklin used X-ray diffraction to take a picture of DNA that changed biology. Photo 51, her picture of DNA, was shown to James Watson and Francis Crick without her knowledge by her colleague Maurice Wilkins who thought she was just a lab assistant when she was heading up her own projects. This photo allowed Watson and Crick to deduce the correct structure for DNA. They published a series of articles in the scientific journal Nature in April 1953. Franklin also published in the same issue and provided even more details on DNA's structure. Though Franklin's image of DNA was critical to deciphering its structure, the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was only awarded to Watson, Crick and Wilkins. Her story is one of the most well-known and shameful instances of a researcher being robbed of credit.</p>

She found a discrepancy between the predicted angular motion of galaxies and the observed motion, by studying galactic rotation curves. Basically she found that things in far reaches of a galaxy rotated at the same speed as things near the center, an unexpected phenomenon called the galaxy rotation problem. A possible explanation was dark matter, that there was more matter in a galaxy than anyone could see. She is best known for discovering evidence of dark matter.<br><br>Rubin struggled with gender barriers throughout her career. She was rejected from the graduate astronomy program at Princeton due to her gender, and later had to meet with a famous astrophysicist in the lobby because women were not allowed in his office area.

		<p class="paragraph">Maria Goeppert-Mayer, a German-born American theoretical physicist, is best known for proposing the nuclear shell model of the atomic nucleus. As known in modern physics, an atom is made up of a nucleus consisting of protons and neutrons surrounded by electrons distributed within shells with a fixed number of electrons. In 1949, Maria developed a model in which nucleons were distributed in shells with different energy levels. She won the Nobel Prize in physics for her groundbreaking work in 1963.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">Valerie Thomas is an American scientist and inventor who patented the illusion transmitter in 1980. After seeing an illusion that involved concave mirrors and light bulbs in a museum, she became curious about how she might apply concave mirrors in her work at NASA. Her invention, the illusion transmitter grew out of her experimentation with concave mirrors. You could call it early 3D technology. Her invention transmits an optical illusion of a 3D image between concave mirrors that looks real on the receiving end. NASA continues to use her technology to this day. She also developed real-time computer data systems to support satellite control centers and oversaw the creation of the NASA Landsat program that spearheaded some of the first image transmissions from space.</p>
